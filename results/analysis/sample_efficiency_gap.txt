# Sample-Efficiency Thresholds (Recovery@k)

Smallest k such that mean Recovery@k >= threshold (percent).
If a threshold is not reached within the tested k-shot values, it is reported as "not reached".

| Threshold (%) | Oracle k* | Oracle Recovery@k | Unlearned (KL) k* | Unlearned Recovery@k | k-Advantage (Oracle - Unlearned) |

| 2.0 | not reached | not reached | not reached | not reached | not reached |
| 5.0 | not reached | not reached | not reached | not reached | not reached |
